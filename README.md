#The Twitch TV API
This application displays a list of Twitch TV broadcasters, information about their current programme, and their current online status.

##This app meets the following User Stories:

* As a User, I can see whether Free Code Camp is currently streaming on Twitch.tv.

* As a User, I can click the status output and be sent directly to the Free Code Camp's Twitch.tv channel.

* As a User, if a Twitch user is currently streaming, I can see additional details about what they are streaming.

* As a User, I will see a placeholder notification if a streamer has closed their Twitch account (or the account never existed). You can verify this works by adding brunofin and comster404 to your array of Twitch streamers.
